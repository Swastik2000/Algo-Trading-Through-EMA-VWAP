# Algo-Trading-Through-EMA-VWAP

## ~ Description
Algorithmic trading uses a computer program that follows a defined set of instructions (an algorithm) to place a trade. This type of trading attempts to leverage the speed and computational resources of computers relative to human traders. The trade, in theory, can generate profits at a speed and frequency that is impossible for a human trader.

The defined sets of instructions are based on timing, price, quantity, and mathematical model based on VWAP and EMA. Apart from profit opportunities for the trader, algo-trading renders markets more liquid and trading more systematic by ruling out the impact of human emotions on trading activities.
